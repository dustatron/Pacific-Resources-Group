## Description

This project is to create a website for my fatherâ€™s business. Ideally this project will display some of the work he has done, recommendations from industry professionals, and credentials as well as contact information. This project will ideally utilize react as a framework and sass for styling. This project will consist mainly of front end as there is really no call for a back end I can see although I would like to implement some as a stretch goal if possible.
